config:
  sequencing_technology: "DNA" # Type of sequencing technology used ("DNA", "10x", "Parse", etc.)
  input: "fastq" # Input file format, can be "fastq" or "bam"
  paired_end: false # Set to true if using paired-end sequencing data
  barcodes_path: false # Path to barcodes file, or set to false if not applicable
  phred33: true # Set to true if the input uses Phred+33 quality scores
  read_qc_threshold: 20 # Quality control threshold for reads
  read_qc_percentage: 80 # Minimum percentage of reads that must meet the QC threshold
  filter_barcodes_relative_abundance: 0.001 # Minimum relative abundance of barcodes to retain
  filter_barcodes_raw_numbers: null # Minimum raw barcode count to retain (null if not used)
  reference: "GCTACTTGAT*ATCCTACTTG" # Reference sequence used for alignment
  contig: null # Contig to extract reads from a bam file, default to unmapped reads '*'

  max_read_length: 40 # Maximum length of reads to be retained
  read_length: 40 # Fixed read length to be used
  aln_mismatches: null #The maximum number of mismatches allowed in the alignment. If not None, edlib is used, otherwise Aho-Corasick is used.
  flanking_mismatches: null #float activates cutadapt to replace the regex matching for flanking regions
  left_flanking_coverage: null #The minimum bp overlap of the left flanking region for cutadapt, default : length of left flanking region (no partial matches).
  right_flanking_coverage: null #The minimum bp overlap of the right flanking region for cutadapt, default : length of right flanking region (no partial matches).
